## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Shader Doesn’t Show**: If the shader does not appear in your list, ensure you imported it correctly. You may need to restart Unity.
- **Performance Issues**: If you notice lag or stuttering, try lowering the quality settings in Unity or reducing the number of active edge detection materials.
- **Visual Artifacts**: For any visual glitches, check the model’s normals and ensure they are correctly set up. Re-importing the model can also help.
